Triton admin guide
==================

Triton is the Aalto high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
researchers of Aalto, but is currently coordinated from within the School of
Science.  It is similar to the CSC clusters, though CSC clusters are larger 
and Triton is easier to use because it is more integrated into the Aalto 
environment.
